# SQL Internship – Task 2: DML & NULL Handling

Objective:
To practice Data Manipulation Language (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) and handle NULLs & constraints using MySQL.

What I Did:
- Populated 'Customers', 'Products', 'Orders' and more with real-world values
- Used 'NULL' to simulate missing data
- Applied 'DEFAULT', 'NOT NULL', and 'ON DELETE CASCADE'
- Demonstrated 'INSERT USING SELECT'
- Cleaned data using 'DELETE' & 'UPDATE'

Files:
- 'task2.sql' -> All DML queries  
- 'ER DIAGRAM.png' ->ER diagram

Concepts Covered:
- NULL handling
- Constraints: NOT NULL, DEFAULT
- Insert with SELECT
- ON DELETE CASCADE

Key Highlights:
-  Used 'realistic data' (names, brands, addresses)
-  Demonstrated 'NULL handling' for missing fields
-  Applied 'UPDATE' to adjust stock after order
-  Used 'AUTO_INCREMENT', 'DEFAULT', and 'CHECK' constraints
-  Uploaded to GitHub in clean format for reusability

This project helped me apply theoretical SQL knowledge to build a fully functional, normalized, and query-ready database system. I look forward to exploring more with Joins, Views, and Stored Procedures in future tasks.
